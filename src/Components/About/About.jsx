          <p>
            While figuring out what I wanted to do after earning a degree in psychology, a friend introduced me to UX design and I learned how user experience and psychology relate to one another.
           <p> I decided to pursue a certificate in UX design, and in the process I discovered my love for not only designing great digital experiences, but creating them as well.</p>
