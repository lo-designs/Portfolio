          <p>
            While figuring out what I wanted to do after earning a degree in psychology, a friend introduced me to UX and I learned how user experience design and psychology intersect. Studying UX design helped me discover my love of digital design and development.
           </p> <p>Since this discovery, I've had the opportunity to work with some great local businesses
            doing web design, as well as UX/UI research and design for clients
            while earning a certificate in UX. Most recently, I completed a full stack development program, had a role as an associate software engineer, and designed and developed this portfolio in my spare time.
